# Share-A-Meal
# Share-A-Meal is an application that facilitates food sharing between members of the community. Those with extra food or leftovers that they wish to share with those interested in receiving, such as those from community shelters, foodbanks, welfare programs, or those in need of extra assistance can easily do so by easily creating a pickup request in the app. Once a request has been made after providing all the necessary details, donors will be matched to recievers based on their location and preferences.  The donor will select a reciever and will then be prompted to upload a picture of the food they wish to donate. The reciever will then have to view the picture and confirm that they wish to recieve the food, as a quality assurance procedure. Then, a distributor will be matched to pickup the food, or the receiver may choose to pick-up the food themselves. Upon receiving the food, the reciever will then confirm delivery and the pickup request will be completed.
