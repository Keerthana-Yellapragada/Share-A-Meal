# Share-A-Meal
# Share-A-Meal is an application that facilitates food sharing between members of the community. Those with extra food or leftovers that they wish to share with those interested in receiving, such as those from community shelters, foodbanks, welfare programs, or those in need of extra assistance can easily do so by easily creating a pickup request in the app.
