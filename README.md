# Introducing "Share-A-Meal"
## Share-A-Meal is an innovative application designed to foster food sharing within the community. It connects individuals who have surplus food or leftovers they wish to share with those in need, such as community shelters, food banks, welfare programs, and people requiring additional assistance. The app simplifies the process by allowing users to create pickup requests effortlessly. Donors can provide all the necessary details, and based on their location and preferences, they will be matched with suitable recipients.

## Once a request is made, the donor will choose a recipient and will be prompted to upload a picture of the food they intend to donate. As part of a quality assurance procedure, the recipient will then view the picture and confirm their desire to receive the food. At this stage, a distributor will be assigned to pick up the food, although the recipient may also opt to collect it themselves. Once the food is received, the recipient will confirm delivery, marking the completion of the pickup request.
